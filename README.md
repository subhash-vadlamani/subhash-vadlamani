# Welcome to Subhash Vadlamani's GitHub! 👋

## About Me
Hello! I'm Subhash, a backend software developer with a strong foundation in Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS. With a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Osmania University and an upcoming Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Florida (graduating May 5th), I bring over 2.5 years of professional software engineering experience to the table. 🎓

## Professional Background
During my time at Delhivery Ltd., I developed and implemented billing APIs handling over $1.3 million in monthly transactions, integrated key logistics platforms, and led performance optimization initiatives that halved response times during peak periods. My work not only involved extensive backend development but also encompassed the successful deployment of applications using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and robustness in high-demand environments. 💻

## Current Interests
I am actively seeking backend software engineering roles focused on Python. Additionally, I am open to opportunities in full-stack web development, where I can leverage my skills in JavaScript and React alongside my backend expertise. 🌐
